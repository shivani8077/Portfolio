# 👋 Hi, I'm Shivani Singh Prajapati  
**Web Developer & AI Enthusiast**

I’m a tech enthusiast driven by curiosity and innovation. With a Master’s in Computer Applications (MCA) and a Bachelor’s in BCA, I bring a blend of academic excellence and hands-on experience.

During my internship as a Junior Software Engineer at **ORITSO Pvt. Ltd**, I contributed to building UI components and integrating APIs using Angular 10, HTML, and CSS. I also explored core concepts of AI/ML during my internship at **Brainwave Matrix Solutions**, gaining experience in real-world applications of machine learning.

I’m passionate about crafting seamless, responsive user experiences and have growing expertise in:
- **Frontend:** Angular, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend & Analytics:** Python, SQL
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI, Tableau
- **Other Tools:** Git, Streamlit, scikit-learn, pandas, NLTK

Currently, I’m looking for **full-time opportunities** in **Web Development** or **Data Analytics**, where I can bring creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills to impactful projects.
